\section{Overview}

This is the manual of \setlX, an interpreter for the \SetlX{} programming-language.

The \SetlX{} language was mostly designed by Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann and is an evolution of \SetlTwo{} by Kirk Snyder and especially the original \Setl{} by Jack Schwartz. It was specifically conceived to make the features of \Setl{} more accessible to today's students of set theories.

The \setlX{} interpreter, which currently is the \SetlX{} reference implementation, was implemented by Tom Herrmann. You may send bug-reports and\slash{}or questions about the \setlX{} interpreter via e-mail to \mailto{setlx@randoom.org}.

\section{Usage}

The \setlX{} interpreter has two basic modes of operation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item file execution mode
	\item interactive mode
\end{itemize}

The `file execution mode' will be started if one or more paths to code files are supplied as parameters for this program. These files will then be parsed and executed in the order in which they are listed as parameters. When executing multiple files, they share the outermost scope.

When no paths are supplied, the `interactive mode' will be started.\\
Note that input will be executed after entering an additional empty line. Hereby multiple lines of input can be parsed and evaluated. Executing the `\command{exit;}' statement will terminate the interpreter.

\nonSubsection{Additional parameters}

In addition to file-paths a number of options can be used when running \setlX{}:

\begin{itemize}
	\param{--help}
	      {displays some helpful information}
	\param{--predictableRandom}
	      {always returns the same pseudo random sequence of numbers from the internal random number generator (for debugging)}
	\param{--real32\\
	       --real64\\
	       --real128\\
	       --real256}
           {sets the width of the real-type in bits (64 is the sane default)}
	\param{--verbose}
           {display the parsed program before executing it (has no effect in interactive mode)}
	\param{--version}
           {displays the interpreter version and terminates}
\end{itemize}

\section{Launching}

When the start script finds the self-contained `.jar' file of the interpreter, it is directly run. If this file is not present, it will try to automatically build the `.jar' on first launch.

\subsection{Unix-like OS (Linux, MacOS X, etc.)}

The \setlX{} interpreter can be launched by opening a terminal, changing into the `\command{interpreter}' sub-directory

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
cd interpreter
\end{lstlisting}

and executing a SetlX program

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
./setlX <path>/<name>.stlx
\end{lstlisting}

or launching the interactive mode.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
./setlX
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{1em}

Optionally, when the interpreter source is available, the interpreter can be intelligently (re)build by executing

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
make
\end{lstlisting}

and/or

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
make jar
\end{lstlisting}

The second one will create a self-contained `.jar' file. This file can be launched on all Java-Platforms without additional scripts, jars or environment-variables by executing

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
java -jar setlX.jar <path>/<name>.stlx
\end{lstlisting}

or

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
java -jar setlX.jar
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Microsoft Windows}

\begin{center}

``Here's a nickel kid. Go buy yourself a real computer.''\footnote{In reference to \url{http://dilbert.com/1995-06-24}}
\end{center}

The \setlX{} interpreter can be launched by opening Microsoft's sort-of-terminal (`Command Prompt'), changing into the `\command{interpreter}' sub-directory

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
cd interpreter
\end{lstlisting}

and executing a SetlX program

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
win-setlX.cmd <path>\<name>.stlx
\end{lstlisting}

or launching the interactive mode.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,numbers=none]
win-setlX.cmd
\end{lstlisting}

It might be possible to execute a \SetlX{} file by dragging it onto the `\command{win-setlX.cmd}' script or to launch the interpreter mode by simply double clicking this script.

\section{System Requirements}

To run \setlX{} a Java runtime is required, which is compatible to Java version 1.5 (aka version 5) or higher.

When building from source, the corresponding Java development kit (JDK) has to be present as well.

The hardware requirements are highly dependent on the executed \SetlX{} program. For optimal performance in most situations at least 512 MB of free main-memory should be available.

\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Stack Overflow \slash{} Out of Memory Error}

Due to its implementation and execution by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a `stack overflow' error may be encountered when executing highly recursive \SetlX{} programs. An `out of memory error' might also be encountered when using very large or very many sets and\slash{}or lists.

The JVM is unable to dynamically increase its internal stack size at all and the heap space only in very limited bounds, no matter how much free memory is available.

To work around these problems, edit the used launching script (`\command{setlX}' or `\command{win-setlX.cmd}') with a text editor and follow the directions given at the top of the script.

\subsection{Limitation Compared to other Setl Versions}

Apart from using a different syntax, the following limitation apply compared to other Setl versions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item All variables and functions are case sensitive.\\
        Predefined functions and keywords use camel case and begin with a lower case letter.
    \item Most explicit type conversions are unsupported.
    \item Explicit constants (`\command{const}') are unsupported.
    \item There are no `\command{until}' and `pure' loops.
    \item Object oriented features are not supported.
\end{itemize}

\section{Disclaimer}
You may distribute \setlX{}, to anyone and for any purpose, and make changed to it, even without permission from the author or notice to the author, as long as you do not remove any copyright information, and also comply with the antlr license.

This program uses the antlr parser generator in version 3.3. As per its license (which is shipped with the interpreter in \command{interpreter/antlr/antlr\_LICENSE.txt}) antlr is not guaranteed to work and might even destroy all life on this planet.
