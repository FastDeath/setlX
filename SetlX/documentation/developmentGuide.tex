\section{Overview}

This is the development guide for \textbf{setlX}, an interpreter for the \textbf{SetlX} programming-language.

\section{Distributions}

Three different 'distributions' can be automatically created:

a)  A binary only distribution, which should work on all Unix-like OS and Windows
    without the need of the full Java JDK.
    Any Java Runtime (JRE) installation which is newer or the same major version
    as the JDK which created the distribution should work.
    This distribution does not include any SetlX code.

b)  A source distribution, which must be rebuild by the user, which is automatically
    attempted on first launch. A Java JDK has to be installed for this to work.
    The version of the users JDK can be lower or even incompatible to the JDK
    which created the distribution.
    This distribution also does not include SetlX code, except a simple program
    to test the interpreter (see 'make test' in Readme.txt).

c)  The development kit, which includes everything used in the development of
    the interpreter itself.
    This distribution includes various SetlX example programs and the grammar of
    the interpreter in both 'EBNF' and 'pure' form.

\subsection{Building distributable zip-files}
(only on Unix-like OS):
    The automated distribution creator script can be launched by executing
        ./createDistributions

    Note that this process will 'clean' the source (e.g. remove all automatically
    created files), rebuild the interpreter and all documentation and clean the source again.
